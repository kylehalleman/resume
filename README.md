I wanted to create a resume that was written completely in Markdown so it could be easily viewed in plain text or using Github's styling for Markdown files. But, I also wanted to use that file to create a Github Pages site with Jekyll to show was can be done using basic semantic HTML and a little bit of CSS. I encourage you to [see my resume site live](https://kylehalleman.github.io/resume/). It's responsive, accessible, and prints to PDF pretty decently. Also take a look at the `style.scss` source. It's not the prettiest CSS due to the constraints of using plain HTML from Markdown, so you will see a lot of element selectors, nested selectors, and other complex selectors that I normally wouldn't write. It was an interesting and fun experiment/challenge to try though, and I think it turned out pretty well.

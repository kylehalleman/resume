Hello,

I wanted to create a resume that was written completely in Markdown so it could be easily viewed in plain text or using Github's styling for Markdown files. But, I also wanted to use that file to create a Github Pages site with Jekyll to show what can be done using basic semantic HTML and a little bit of CSS. I encourage you to [check out my resume](https://kylehalleman.github.io/resume/resume.html). It's responsive, accessible, and prints to PDF pretty decently. Also take a look at the [`style.scss`](https://github.com/kylehalleman/resume/blob/master/assets/css/style.scss) source. It's not the prettiest CSS due to the constraints of using plain HTML from Markdown, so you will see a lot of element selectors, nested selectors, and other complex selectors that I normally wouldn't write. It was an interesting and fun experiment/challenge to try though, and I think it turned out pretty well.

Thank you for taking the time,

Kyle Halleman

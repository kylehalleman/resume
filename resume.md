# Kyle Halleman


The web is what I think about. I believe it should be available to everyone, so I focus on **accessibility**, **responsive design**, and **performance**. I love writing **React**, but lately I’ve been thinking about how we can move beyond React to work with web standards to make a simpler, more robust web experience. I am passionate about all facets of front-end development, but I particularly focus on the **intersection between UX and the front end**.

## Work experience
### Northwestern Mutual *(Milwaukee, WI)*
#### Lead software engineer *August 2024–Present*
##### Responsibilities
* Created a complementary component library to the enterprise design system—tailored for the client website experience—gaining adoption in 33 apps (37%) within the first year, featuring 29 components (and growing).
* Provided **hands-on support for client website teams** to identify and fix bugs, adopt new libraries, and migrate to new ways of creating apps.
* Introduced a **new layout system** that focuses on primitive utilities that are **responsive to their content and containers** without using media nor container queries.
* **Embedded on the design system team** for a quarter to help lead the from-the-ground-up rewrite, with emphasis on the build system, styling architecture, component APIs, layout system, design tokens, iconography, and typography.
* Held interactive feedback sessions with teams across the enterprise to promote and share insights into the new version of the design system
* **Worked extensively with the design system team** on improving the legacy version of the system, contributing 57 merge requests.
* Paired with engineers **and designers** across the client website on a regular basis to help level up the skillsets of more junior engineers and help **grow the relationship with the design organization** and reduce feedback loops.
* Worked with design and product on a site-wide **design consistency effort** to create a more cohesive user experience for the client website and mobile platforms.
* Promoted **a lightweight and flexible CSS strategy** for both the client website and the enterprise design system, **reducing our dependency on third-party tools**.
* Facilitated a fortnightly department-wide lunch and learn series that helped break down silos between teams and build a sense of community. I personally gave 7 talks in this series.
* Ran a one-day **workshop for 100+ back-end engineers** in another department exploring the current state of front-end development at Northwestern Mutual and beyond.
* Joined the “accessibility ambassador” program and **became an accessibility specialist**, conducting audits for new features and helping create an accessibility practice for the client website.
* **Mentored two junior engineers**, both of whom I continue to mentor after the 6-month program ended, helping one engineer through an internal interview and promotion process.

#### Senior software engineer *June 2020–July 2024*
##### Responsibilities
* Created and maintained a fully auditable web interface for financial representatives to securely instant message with clients, using smart polling strategies with **React Query** to avoid overloading our **GraphQL API**.

* Intimately collaborated with the design team to prototype, implement, and iterate on new features for our secure chat product, sharing insights on feasibility and accessibility to end up with the strongest product possible for our users.
* Maintained and improved a **Redux**-based legacy notifications dashboard for financial representatives to easily see in near-real time when clients accomplished tasks and goals.
* Used **atomic design** principles to create shared components and templates for email and web notifications, showcasing them on internal **Storybook** sites for our publishers.
* Created and maintained an internal NPM package to streamline setup of new **JavaScript** and **TypeScript** projects and ensure consistency of testing, linting, formatting, and configurations.
* Promoted **stronger accessibility** adherence with product, engineering, and design teams.
* Held a twice-monthly meeting for my team teaching front-end skills to help improve the skillset of the mostly back-end engineers.
* Shared new techniques and experiences with the company via internal blog posts and talks, including lessons learned from implementing **Next.js** in our company’s infrastructure.
* Created our team’s documentation site to openly share our processes and thoughts with the entire company and provide internal-facing documentation with teams implementing our platform.

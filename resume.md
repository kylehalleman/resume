# Kyle Halleman

The web is what I think about. I believe it should be available to everyone, so I focus on **accessibility**, **responsive design**, and **performance**. I love writing **React** with **TypeScript**—it maps so well to my mental model of UI development. I am passionate about all facets of front-end development, but I particularly focus on the **intersection between UX and the front end**.
